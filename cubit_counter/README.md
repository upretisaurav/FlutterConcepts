# Counter App using Cubit

This is a simple counter app built with Flutter to demonstrate the use of `Cubit` for state management as part of learning the BLoC (Business Logic Component) architecture.

## Features

- **Increment Counter:** Click the button to increase the counter value.
- **Cubit State Management:** The app uses `Cubit` from the BLoC package to handle state changes efficiently.
- **Learning BLoC Architecture:** This project is aimed at understanding the basics of BLoC in Flutter.

## Key Concepts

- **Cubit:** A simpler form of BLoC that handles state management with fewer boilerplate codes.
- **State Management:** All state changes in the app (e.g., incrementing the counter) are handled through the `Cubit` class, making the code more predictable and testable.
